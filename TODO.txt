EUREKA SHORT-TERM TODO
======================


General
-------



Documentation
-------------

+  document texture browser (RIGHT click etc)

+  MAIN PAGE: put a screenshot there (half size)

-  somewhere: at least 800x600 resolution

-  KEY CHANGES
   3d mode : 's' --> 'o' (objects)
             'w' --> 'v'
             added WASD for movement (fine with SHIFT)
             'g' --> toggle gravity
             PGUP / PGDN can move up (merely document)


Coding
------



Editing
-------

+  the inside of a simple loop : DEFAULT??  (was not match neighbor)

-  option to disable automatic texture alignment

-  IDEA: multi-select is the default

-  IDEA: mouse click to insert vertices/lines and things

I think the snap size for insert vertices should be a bit larger.
Right now it's hard to get them on an angled line, even at the
smaller grid sizes (16x16, 8x8 - smallest I commonly work with).

-  sort out MMB for rotate/scale


Browser
-------

-  mouse wheel too slow on textures
   (a) default is bigger
   (b) configurable


Renderer
--------


Game / Port Definitions
