Eureka TODO / WISHLIST
======================


-  Bug: when loading new WAD, may have different TEXTURES (etc)
   (i.e. master directory changes, but have not reloaded anything)


______________________________________________________________________

  HIGH PRIORITY
______________________________________________________________________


General
-------

+  WIN32 : ditch the installer, use "unpack" method

+  Preferences:
   -  ability to change what mouse buttons do
   -  ability to change mouse move/turn speed in 3D view

+  Restore last window position and maximized state

+  grid : scroll speed preferences

+  Hexen support

+  BOOM Generalized line types / sectors



Documentation
-------------

+  a tutorial for the basics
   
   - especially drawing lines in VERTEX mode

+  information on each binding command, parameters etc..

+  cannot Undo after building nodes
   -  happens because we reload the map (because the current WAD file 
      has been replaced by a new one)



Editing
-------

++  a Find/Replace dialog, especially for textures and flats
    but also for thing numbers, line/sector specials, etc...

    [ an expression parser for e.g. sec.floor_tex == "FLAT2" || sec.ceil_tex == "TLITE3" ]



3D View

Browser

______________________________________________________________________

  LOWER PRIORITY
______________________________________________________________________


General
-------

+  a toolbar

+  ability to hide the right-side panel

+  ability to build nodes only in modified maps

+  SHIFT + move mouse = keep current highlight

?  ENTER key pops up an "operation" menu, which provides all the
   commands that can be done via the keyboard (e.g. flip linedefs)

+  check that current pwad has been externally modified

+  Preferences window:
   +  add backup_max_files / backup_max_space
   -  implement the scrolling sizes
   -  add more stuff (see USER CONFIG NEEDED, below)

+  a dialog to view / load / prune backups.

IDEA: ability to edit Lua code for OBLIGE prefabs

WISH: support Windows 95/98/ME

      [running on Windows 98SE requires KernelEx]

WISH: support UDMF format


-  File / Test Map
   +  make filenames absolute
   +  configurable stuff:
      -  directory to 'cd' into
      -  program to invoke
      -  arguments to use (-iwad, -file, -merge, -warp)
   -  support resource wads
   -  make sure the user built the nodes
      (ideally invoke it automatically)

?  GUI buttons for NewTag / LastTag commands

-  vertex/linedef mode: '[' and ']' to adjust length of current line

-  binding functions for all menu stuff (NewMap, OpenMap, etc....)
   (perhaps prefix with MENU_xxx)

-  improve Key binding preferences:
   +  "Grab" button in UI_EditKey
   -  "Find" or "Match" button for function in UI_EditKey
   -  reverse ordering of KCTX_XXX values

?  config system: OPT_KEY values

-  make sure Load/Export wad filename not already in master_dir

-  PRINT key to make a screenshot of map or 3D view

-  in EUREKA lump, if a path is under $HOME store it as "~/blah..."
   and expand that syntax on load.

-  ability to view (perhaps edit) a map header lump
   (for FraggleScript etc...)

-  ability to create / view / edit / import arbitrary lumps
   (e.g. MAPINFO, DECORATE, etc...)


?  an auto-save feature (e.g. save every N minutes unless no
   changes occurred in the last N minutes).
   really needs the backup view/load/prune dialog too.

?  a way to slow down fake mouse wheels?

?  nicer way to select map, render a small 2D version of each map
   and present them in a scrolling list.

?  MacOSX:
   (c) handle the -psnXXX argument (see SDL_main.m)
       NOTE: probably needs integrating some of SDL's logic

IDEA: a dialog to specify directories to find wads.
      Initially populate it with the currently hard-coded places
      and $DOOMWADDIR and $DOOMWADPATH.  Perhaps add places where
      the user opened a wad automatically (or ask?).

IDEA: after inserting a new object, allow moving another object
      (i.e. set edit.did_a_move = true).  Perhaps config item.

WISH: flat drawing in the 2D editing modes

WISH: support ZDoom PK3 for textures (etc)

WISH: support DDF as (or in) a resource file

WISH: support DECORATE as (or in) a resource file



Documentation
-------------

+  add supported OSes -- e.g. Windows >= 2000

-  make a manpage for the debian package, list cmdline options

-  document texture browser (RIGHT click etc)

?    command line arguments page



Coding
------

-  rename code files:
      selectn.cc/h  --> x_select.cc/h
      objects.cc/h  --> x_object.cc/h
      editloop.cc/h --> m_editor.cc/h

-  have XXX_NotifyNewMap() functions

-  replace usage(s) of fl_input



Editing
-------

-  move 'k' split linedef to SPACE/INSERT, put vertex where mouse is

+  a menu for inserting shapes, especially N-sided polygon

+  support PNG (etc?) image formats [enabled by a port definition]
   -->  feature png

-  support TX_START / TX_END namespace for textures
   -->  feature tx_start

+  when dragging a shape next to existing geometry, highlight
   vertices and linedefs which would get merged, and implement
   that merging.

!!  handle self-referencing linedefs in auto create/split sector

+  for the "Edit -> Paste" menu, turn the cursor into crosshairs
   and wait until the user selects a spot to paste to.

+  View / Find
   (use GoToObject for first match, FindNext starts at selected + 1)

   -  VERTEX mode : useful ??
   -  THING mode : match on type (possibly on flags, TID for hexen)
   -  SECTOR mode: match on type / desc / tag / flat
   -  LINEDEF mode: match on type / desc / tag / texture

+  grid drawing too slow when small step and zoomed out
   (since we render a huge number of dots)

   --> create an in-memory image (e.g. 64x64) of the dotty grid 
       and blast it repeatedly to the window


-  assume texture names beginning with '#' are special

-  View / Toggle skill mode

?  when highlighting a sector, draw the things in the same color as
   the sector is highlighted, but not as bright.  Because many sector
   functions will affect things too -- make it obvious to the user.

-  disallow insert of new linedef if it would overlap or cross
   an existing linedef (or touch an existing vertex).
   [overridden when SHIFT is pressed, but no auto sectoring then]

   THIS --> if new linedef would cross an existing one, then just
            create a new vertex at the intersection point.

            AND: similarly if a new linedef passes through an
                 existing vertex -- create two instead.

   __IDEA__ the 'c' key in linedef mode to fix crossing / overlaps

-  quantization function: prevent linedefs from overlapping / crossing

-  Multi-select : if CTRL is pressed, don't clear selection after drag

-  exchange object numbers

-  some port-specific line/thing flags

?  disconnect sectors : include islands (perhaps with 'D')

?  when moving a sector and the camera is inside it, move camera too

?  fix PointOutsideOfMap() code to handle places where the point
   cannot "see" the surrounding void space.
   
   TraceLineLoop on the linedef to the right, if faces_outward
   then test upto 32 lines (OppositeLineDef) to see if any can
   see the void.

   if geometry is broken : special result.

IDEA: for quantizing a group of objects, try about 9 delta
      positions (x+0, x+step/4, x-step/4 etc...) and choose the
      "best" quantization.



3D View
-------

++  an info bar:  X  Y  Z  ANG  GRAVITY  TEX/LIT/OBJ

-  option to reverse mouse movement

+  smooth movement via keyboard
   -  call a function in Main_Loop
   -  if did a move, Fl::wait(0) instead of 0.2
   -  handle key up/down events in UI_Canvas::handle()

-  handle very tall/thin window : letter box with black

-  closed sectors have a see-through gap (gets bigger further away)

+  being able to select stuff to modify:
   - things
   - floors
   - ceilings
   - sidedef uppers and lowers

-  moving up/down with RMB should not disable gravity when change
   is small

-  able to drag things around
   - raise floors?
   - move vertices?
   + shift textures?

-  View/Place Camera command, cursor turns into +

-  rotated sprites

?  extrafloors

IDEA: a key (or mouse button) to toggle "grab mouse" mode

IDEA: animation mode, render continuously and show any lighting
      effects and animated / scrolling textures and sprites



Browser
-------

-  a "Used in map" category (sorted by usage)

+  when opened by a click, jump to the texture/thing/etc clicked on

-  can change the [max] size of the texture/flat previews

-  scroll speed (i.e. linesize) is configurable

-  no-pic mode for textures and flats

-  search box: ',' for AND, '/' for OR

-  preference for # of RECENT items

?  command to clear the recent lists



Game / Port Definitions
-----------------------

+  ability to "remove line 271" (etc)

+  finish HacX support -- categorize the textures

+  support Harmony

-  support Chex Quest 1 and 2

-  FreeDOOM: categorize the new textures

-  a new category for BOOM's "property transfer" linetypes


______________________________________________________________________

NO:  un-hard-code menu shortcuts?

NO:  Scripting language

     perhaps: --create or --new option?

NO:  built-in cheat sheet for mouse buttons and common keys

NO:  document the config file syntax

NO:  when one vertex of a linedef is moved (and not the other)
     update the X offset on the appropriate side (right side for start,
     left side for end vertex).

NO:  merge vertex and linedef modes

NO:  ability to drag the camera (on 2D viewport)
