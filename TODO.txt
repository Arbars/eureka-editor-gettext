EUREKA SHORT-TERM TODO
======================


General
-------



Documentation
-------------

+  document texture browser (RIGHT click etc)

+  MAIN PAGE: put a screenshot there (half size)

-  somewhere: require at least 800x600 resolution, two button mouse

-  KEY CHANGES
   3d mode : 's' --> 'o' (objects)
             'w' --> 'v'
             added WASD for movement (fine with SHIFT)
             'g' --> toggle gravity
             PGUP / PGDN can move up (merely document)


Coding
------



Editing
-------

+  sort out MMB for insert/rotate/scale

I think the snap size for insert vertices should be a bit larger.
Right now it's hard to get them on an angled line, even at the
smaller grid sizes (16x16, 8x8 - smallest I commonly work with).
