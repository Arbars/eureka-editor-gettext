EUREKA SHORT-TERM TODO
======================


General
-------

+  support resource wads
   (a) -merge option for command line [DONE!]
   (b) open them in R/O mode (like the IWAD)
   (c) File / Manage Wads: a window showing iwad, pwad & resource wads,
       [probably port and mod too] and ability to change them
   (d) persist in a lump, e.g. "__EUREKA"
   (e) load definitions from mods/<base>.ugh

-  make multi-select optional (if off, require CTRL key)

Coding
------


Editing
-------

-  disable 'next' and 'prev' mis-feature

   OLD IDEA: probably use selection:
   -  if nothing selected, select the first/last object
   -  if one object selected, reselect the next (beep if last)
   -  beep if 2+ objects selected

-  jump to object (need a decent GoToObject)

SUGGEST: Probably switching around [/] and ,/. -- the keys on the lower row
         should be responsible for floor height and ones on the higher low for
         the ceiling height.


Browser
-------

DONE:  picture mode for things


Renderer

Game / Port Definitions
