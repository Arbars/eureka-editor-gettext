EUREKA SHORT-TERM TODO
======================


General
-------

!! don't create new linedef overlapping existing one
   -  partial overlap : split line / create new vertex
   -  full overlap : ignore

-  SPACE on selected vertex : deselect


++  Sector creation / correction / copying:

    Needed functions
    (a) in an area without any sector, add a NEW sector there
        (ideally copying values from a nearby sector)
        ---> SPACE

        [there cannot be a highlight]
        [if a single sector is selected, copy values from it]
        [if multiple selected sector -- ignore? beep? copy first?]

        AFTER: this sector becomes selected

    (b) in an area with sectoring (broken or not), add a NEW sector
        --->  CTRL + SPACE   [the CTRL forces a NEW sector to be made]

        [if a single sector is selected, copy values from it -- overrides highlight]
        [else if a sector is highlighted, copy that]
        [else use logic from (a)]

        AFTER: this sector becomes selected

    (c) in an area with broken sectoring, fix the sectoring using the
        currently highlighted one.
        ---> SPACE

        The presence of a highlighted sector is what differentiates
        case (c) from case (a).

        [if sectors are selected -- ignore? beep?]

        this sector DOES NOT get selected  [because it is NOT NEW]

    (d) copy properties from an existing sector (selected) to
        the highlighted one.  Beep if invalid selection.
        --> 'c' copy command

        Hmmm, does it make more sense to select the TARGETs and
        copy from the Highlight ??? ---- CONFIG ITEM!

    (e) in any area, change sector to an existing one [selected]
        (i.e. grow that existing sector)
        ---> 'm' merge command
