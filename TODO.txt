EUREKA SHORT-TERM TODO
======================


General
-------


IDEA: when no pwad given, load RECENT thing


>>>  new Open Map dialog

    +  review the logic

    -  make sure window title reflects the real state


+  support resource wads
   (a) -merge option for command line [DONE!]
   (b) open them in R/O mode [DONE]
   (e) load definitions from mods/<base>.ugh  [DONE]

>>>   (c) File / Manage Wads: a window showing iwad, pwad & resource wads,
       [probably port and mod too] and ability to change them

   (d) persist in a lump, e.g. "__EUREKA"

       # Eureka project info
       iwad blah_Blah
       port edge
       resource foo
       resource bar
       resource jiminy_cricket

  -  may need a list of "known iwads" (store in a new .cfg file),
     when user selects an iwad, add full path there.
     
     perhaps rename m_recent.cc --> m_files.cc and put this logic
     there (as well some stuff currently in main.cc).

     Integrate with SearchDirForIwad() stuff....


IDEA: allow ".ugh" files as resources
      (and perhaps even DDF files)


>>>  Preferences window
    - codin' time!


-  fl_choice for some dialogs
