CHANGES IN Eureka
=================

-  added back the '192' grid size

-  fixed bug not loading 'ASHWALL' texture for DOOM 1

-  fixed bug when saving and using the 'ExMx' buttons
   (an erroneous newline was added into the map's lump name)

-  support loading a read-only wad file

-  support data in a map header lump (such as MAP01), make sure to
   save it when saving the map (instead of removing it)

-  show version _in_ the About box (not just the window title)

-  node builder : added work-around for "TOO SIMPLE" levels
   (i.e. a single convex sector), creating a dummy node and an
   extra subsector and seg for the back side

-  3D view : fixed a vertical mis-alignment of textures (one pixel)
   in certain circumstances

-  vanilla DOOM: do not show "friend", "coop" or "sp" thing flags

-  in Linedef panel swapped the 'Tag' and 'Length' widgets

-  the -warp option can now be followed by two numeric arguments
   (episode and map number), compatible with vanilla DOOM

-  the 'New Map' dialog now has a "New File" check button, when
   selected it disabled the map selection and next save (CTRL-S)
   will ask to export into a new file.
