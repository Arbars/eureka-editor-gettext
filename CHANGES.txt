CHANGES IN Eureka
=================

>>  Find and Replace 

+  new 'RECENT' category for Texture/Flat/Thing browsers,
   and rebound the '\' key to toggle this category on/off

+  new 'File / Delete Map' command

+  new 'File / Rename Map' command

+  vertex reshaping commands:
   -  'I' moves selected vertices onto a line
   -  'O' moves them into a circle shape
   -  'D' moves them into a half-circle
   -  'C' moves then into a 90-degree arc


-  a preference to show smaller textures in the browser

-  support loading a read-only wad file

-  support data in a map header lump (such as MAP01), make sure to
   save it when saving the map (instead of removing it)

-  always show a two-sided line in the LineDef panel when multiple
   lines are selected (allowing the back sides to be edited)

-  in Linedef panel swapped the 'Tag' and 'Length' positions

-  default properties now has its own panel


-  node builder : added work-around for "TOO SIMPLE" levels
   (i.e. a single convex sector), creating a dummy node and an
   extra subsector and seg for the back side

-  vanilla DOOM: do not show "friend", "coop" or "sp" thing flags

-  support -warp option being followed by two numeric arguments
   (episode and map number), compatible with vanilla DOOM

-  the 'New Map' dialog now has a "New WAD File" radio button, when
   selected it disables the map selection and immediately asks for
   a file to save (export) the new map into

-  new preference to maximize window on start (Linux, WIN32 only)

-  show version _in_ the About box (not just the window title)

-  added 'Toggle 3D View' command to View menu

-  added back the '192' grid size


Bug Fixes:

-  fixed not loading 'ASHWALL' texture for DOOM 1

-  fixed bug when saving and using the 'ExMx' buttons
   (an erroneous newline was added into the map's lump name)

-  3D view : fixed a vertical mis-alignment of textures (one pixel)
   in certain circumstances

-  fixed occasional false positives with sector mismatch test

-  fixed wrong focal point when zooming immediately after the 'j'
   (JumpToObject) command

-  fixed clipping of mid-masked textures (e.g. the cage in E1M9)
